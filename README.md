# Fragalysis
The "start here" repository for the Fragalysis Stack application.
This repository (which is currently **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**) will be used
as a 'base' for all documentation relating to the application.

>   This replaces the original fragalysis repository, which was responsible for the
    RDKit-based Python tools for analysis of protein-ligand interactions.
    The original repository has been renamed and can now be found in the
    [fragalysis-package] repository.
